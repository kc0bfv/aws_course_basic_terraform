You're on your own for this one :-)  Maybe start with the Linux stuff.

You'll need to change the security group to allow RDP.

You'll need to add "get_password_data = true" to the aws_instance...

You'll need to add a password output to the end like this:

output "password" {
  value = rsadecrypt(aws_instance.windows.password_data, file("course_key"))
}
